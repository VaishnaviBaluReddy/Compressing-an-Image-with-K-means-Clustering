# Compressing-an-Image-with-K-means-Clustering
This project focuses on reducing the size of an image while maintaining its visual quality by leveraging the power of K-Means Clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm.

## Description
Image compression plays a crucial role in various domains where efficient storage and transmission of images are required. This project utilizes K-Means Clustering to significantly reduce the number of distinct colors used in an image, thereby achieving compression without significant loss of visual information.<br><br>

The repository contains two essential files:

**Original Image**: The original image file that serves as the input for compression. This high-resolution image showcases the effectiveness of the compression algorithm.<br>
**Jupyter Notebook**: The Jupyter Notebook file contains the code and step-by-step instructions to perform image compression using K-Means Clustering. It provides a detailed explanation of the process, including loading the image, applying K-Means Clustering, and reconstructing the compressed image.<br>
## Usage
To compress your own images using K-Means Clustering, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-compression-kmeans.git<br>
- Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment.<br>
- Load the original image and specify the desired number of clusters (K) for compression.<br>
- Execute the code cells to perform K-Means Clustering and reconstruct the compressed image.<br>
- Analyze the compression results, comparing the size reduction and visual quality of the compressed image.<br>
- Feel free to experiment with different images and adjust the number of clusters to explore the trade-off between compression ratio and image fidelity.<br><br>

## Conclusion
The Image Compression using K-Means Clustering project offers an intuitive approach to reduce image size while preserving essential visual information. By leveraging the powerful K-Means Clustering algorithm, this project demonstrates an efficient method for image compression.

Whether you are interested in image processing, data compression techniques, or optimizing storage and transmission of visual data, this repository provides valuable insights and a practical implementation to explore the possibilities of K-Means Clustering for image compression.

Enjoy compressing your images and discovering the balance between size reduction and image quality!
